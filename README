A toy program for stepping through a binary.

Step will set a break point at main, and single step through the entire program or until the user enters q.

At each state, the currently running assembly instruction, the values stored at registers, and the contents stored at the
top (bottom?) of the stack is displayed. There are helpful annotations, such as the compare flags, documentation for the
various jump instructions, etc.

Requires the libraries (included) libdasm and libelf. Compiling libdasm is straightforward; libelf requires installation.
Follow instructions given there.

The target for this program is x86 Linux machines.
